<ul style=“list-style-type:square”>
<dd><B><li>Gateway of India</li></B>
Gateway of India, the best place to visit in Mumbai, was built in 1924 by George Willet to honor the visit of King George V and Queen Mary to Mumbai. Visit this place in the early morning or late evening hours to enjoy the cool breeze of the sea with your family sans the crowd. Located next to the iconic Taj Mahal Palace and facing the vast Arabian Sea, the Gateway of India leaves you spellbound in every way possible.

<dd><B><li>Sanjay Gandhi National Park</li></B>
Sprawling over an area of 104 sq. km. of land, this is one of the most-visited national parks in Asia and because of this, I give it the 2nd spot among Mumbai’s famous places. With all sorts of fun activities, this park can surely be a family entertainer. You can watch the big cats of the park close enough in a safari cage and have a fun day boating in the artificial lake in the park.

Come to the city of dreams and fulfil this dream at the Red Carpet Wax Museum. It exhibits lifelike wax figures of prominent icons from various fields including science, politics, sports and world cinema.

<dd><B><li> Haji Ali Dargah</li></B>
Haji Ali Dargah that houses the tomb of Sayed Peer Haji Ali Shah Bukhari. This grand edifice is made of white marbles and exemplifies the Indo-Islamic style of architecture. A walk through the causeway that connects the Dargah to the Lala Rajput Rai Marg is the main attraction of this place. Feel the spirituality of this place with your dear ones while enjoying a panoramic view of the deep blue waters! I give the places Fab rank no.4 among all the best places to visit in Mumbai.
<ul style=“list-style-type:arrow”>
<li>Location: Dargah Road</li>

</ul>
<dd><B><li>Elephanta Caves</li></B>
 It has five caves dedicated to Hindu god Shiva and two caves depicting Buddhist architectures. To reach this place, you need to take a one-hour ferry ride from the Gateway of India. The ferry ride is definitely one of the best things to do in Mumbai as you get to enjoy the scenic beauty of the city. Those who lack the spirit of a trekker can hop on the toy train that will take you on a tour of the caves right from the entry point. The restaurant and canteen run by MTDC can take care of your hunger pangs.
