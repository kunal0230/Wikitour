<dt><B>Delhi </B></dt>
<dd>Delhi is both a union territory within India, as well as a city, and features two very different worlds: New Delhi and Old Delhi. The former, inaugurated by the British in 1931 to serve as the imperial capital, is the nation's modern capital and seat of government, while Old Delhi is considered by many as the symbolic heart of the greater metropolitan area.

One of the most popular New Delhi parks among locals, the 90-acre Lodi Gardens is well-worth including on your Delhi itinerary. In addition to its lush gardens, the park contains numerous relics from the Lodi period pre-1600s, including a variety of important tombs and ruins.

Delhi's most important Sikh place of worship, the 18th-century Gurdwara Bangla Sahib is located near Connaught Place and is well worth a visit. Highlights include its magnificent pool, the Sarovar, at the heart of this large complex, as well as its famous gold dome and flagpole.

<dd><B><li>The Lotus Temple</li></B>
The magnificent Bahá'í House of Worship, also known as the Lotus Temple due to its nine sides and stunning central dome, is an architectural masterpiece. Constructed of white concrete and marble, the entire structure looks as delicate as the flower it resembles. Rising from the surrounding nine pools of water, it almost appears as if it might burst into bloom at any moment.

Looking a little like the famous Arc de Triomphe in Paris, the equally impressive India Gate is a magnificent stone arch built as a memorial to Indian soldiers killed in WWI. An eternal flame burns beneath the massive structure, and its walls are inscribed with the names of more than 90,000 soldiers who died in the conflict.
